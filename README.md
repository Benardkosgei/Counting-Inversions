 # Counting Inversions

## Introduction

This repository contains a Python program that addresses the problem of counting inversions in an array. An inversion occurs when \(i < j\) and \(A[i] > A[j]\). The goal is to achieve this with a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\).

## Problem Statement

Given an array \(A\), write a Python program to find the number of inversions in the array with the specified time complexity.

## Instructions

- Use the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice to write the code.
- Ensure that your single Python file (`Counting_Inversions.py`) can be executed outside the IDE environment with no dependency on any other file.
- Read input samples from the file named `Counting_Inversions_input.txt` in the same directory as your program (uploaded here).
- Your code should process each line of input samples separately. First, print out the array in a line itself (e.g., `Array: 1, 9, 6, 4`), and then in a new line print the answer (e.g., `Number of inversions: 3`). Repeat the process for every line of the input file.
- Do not write the answer to a file; it is not needed.
- Do not use built-in functions for sorting or finding the maximum; follow the guidelines discussed in class and related slides.

## Execution

To execute the program, run the following command:

```bash
python Counting_Inversions.py
```

Ensure that the `Counting_Inversions_input.txt` file is present in the same directory.
